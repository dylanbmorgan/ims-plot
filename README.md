# Visualisation of Aromaticity in Macrocycles

Visualisation of macrocycles is important to enable greater understanding of how they work and their potential
applications in battery electrodes and photovoltaic cells. Current methods of visualising aromaticity are not fit for large
macrocycles containing both aromatic and anti-aromatic components. Generally, GIMIC, ACID, and NICS are the main
techniques used for visualising aromaticity.<sup>1–3</sup> An example from this paper shows an ACID plot visualising electron density
with the manual addition of arrows to represent ring currents and magnetic fields generated by NMR (figure 1).<sup>4</sup>
An approach based around NICS may prove to be more successful in
creating a better picture. Whilst visualisation of aromaticity has been
shown using 1D and 2D NICS contour plots, it's believed 3D NICS iso-contour plots have yet to be employed to visualise aromaticity and
anti-aromaticity (figure 2).<sup>5</sup>
These aromatic switching molecules are of interest as they could
potentially be used for degradation-resistant electrodes in sodium ion
batteries and chromophores in photovoltaic cells.<sup>4,6</sup>

# Aims & Objectives
* Create a process that will enable clear visualisation of macrocycles switching between aromatic and anti-aromatic in 1D, 2D, and ultimately 3D<br  />
* Enable areas of negative and positive NMR chemical shift to be shown by a plot generated from the process<br  />
  * Based off of NICS method<br  />
  * If aromatic, centre of molecule will be shown as negative chemical shift whilst outside is positive. Achieved via an isocontour plot<br  />
  * Vice-versa for anti-aromatic molecules<br  />
* Will be able to visualise macrocycles which have individual aromatic components but the entire molecule is anti-aromatic and observe the difference<br  />
